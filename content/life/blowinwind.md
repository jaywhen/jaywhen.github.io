```
How many roads must a man walk down
Before you call him a man

How many seas must a white dove sail
Before she sleeps in the sand

How many times must the cannon balls fly
Before they're forever banned

The answer, my friend, is blowing in the wind
The answer is blowing in the wind

How many years can a mountain exist
Before it is washed to the sea

How many years can some people exist
Before they're allowed to be free

How many times can a man turn his head
And pretend that he just doesn't see

The answer, my friend, is blowing in the wind
The answer is blowing in the wind

How many times must a man look up
Before he really see the sky

How many ears must one man have
Before he can hear people cry

How many deaths will it take
Till he knows that too many people have died

The answer, my friend, is blowing in the wind
The answer is blowing in the wind
```
