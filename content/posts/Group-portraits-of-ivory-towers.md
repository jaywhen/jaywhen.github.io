## A

It is rare to be able to sit down and discuss problems with students. He is obsessed with C-Qt spells. He is upright and does not follow fame and fortune. He is a qualified person. But I personally think that his language skills are not good. This Perhaps it was the reason why he failed to do the subsequent training courses.

## B

He is the only respectable person in the ivory tower. He is kind and does not have the shelf. He often communicates with students. I have only taken the basic magic courses she taught. It can be seen that she is very focused every time she lectures and attaches great importance to basic teaching. When communicating with students, they will also plan their future paths.

## C

The typical fish-fishing in ordinary Chinese colleges and universities, it can be seen that he does not understand the field he teaches at all. It may be developed by the robot OS that has read the basic outdated and inferior textbooks, and then "transmits" this knowledge to His students. He always concealed his lack of learning skills by taking professional spell classes to take Western word tests, and he also liked to push students. When the students did better, he would intensify their demands and even put forward outrageous demands.

## D

The training class in the ivory tower has some experience in outsourcing and likes to use the traditional art combination S+V of the training class. A junior little mage who has no spell experience may be bewitched by his spells and believe that he is the first mage in the ivory tower. But what is the fact? He refuses to communicate and has a strong desire to control. He hopes that students can and can only follow his ideas. He also likes to post many outrageous and even vague requirements for junior mages to complete. In short, he can go to the training class. Lecturer, but I don’t think he should appear in the ivory tower anyway.

## E

D Mage’s contract mage. Personally think that there is almost no coding ability, all rely on flicker. But the people are pretty good.

## F

The people are pretty good, and they can get along with the students. They are what the Master of Ivory Tower should be. They can do advanced legal research and write code.

## G

Buddhism, not push, is an excellent research master.
